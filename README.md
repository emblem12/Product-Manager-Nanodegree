# Product-Manager-Nanodegree

> Product Managers are responsible for designing and delivering a profitable product or feature into the market. 
  In this program, you will learn to define product strategy and KPIs based on market analysis, pitch a product vision to get stakeholder buy-in,
  and design a user-centered prototype that adheres to engineering constraints. Then, you will develop an execution timeline that handles competing priorities,
  communicate a product roadmap that builds consensus amongst internal stakeholders, and create a comprehensive go-to-market plan based on product KPIs. 
  Finally, you will build tests to enhance product features based on market data.
  
  
  
# Project 1: Product Strategy - Pitch a Product Vision


> In this project, I served as a product manager for one of the four top technology companies and developed a compelling pitch for the development of a new product. 
  Based on the provided business scenario of the company chosen, I performed primary and secondary market research to identify targeted users and 
  sized the market opportunities for a new product. I lastly compiled the analysis into a pitch deck, and presented the vision of the product to business stakeholders.
  
  
  
# Project 2: Product Design - Run a Design Sprint

> In this project, I took a problem/opportunity (using work from the previous course) through a Design Sprint. During the Design Sprint, I explored multiple ideas, narrowed down ideas to the 
  most compelling one, created a storyboard and prototype, conducted user research, refined ideas, and incorporated findings into a final product spec.
  
  
  
# Project 3: Product Development - Manage the Product Development Process

> In this project, I compiled a sprint backlog with a clearly defined sprint goal that reflects the prioritized user stories and detailed acceptance criteria. 
  I also refined the solution by leveraging API documentation. Then, created a coordination activities map and handled competing priorities ranging from 
  reported production issues and resource constraints, to stakeholder feedback and requests that came up during product development.
 
 
 
# Project 4: Product Launch - Deliver a Product to Market

> In this final project, I took the product developed in the earlier courses and brought it to market. I furthermore created a pre-launch process, including 
  identification of launch risks and mitigations. Also, I developed a marketing and pricing strategy, and created collateral to prepare the Sales and 
  Customer Support teams to evangelize the product. I lastly used customer feedback to design an A/B test for a new product feature.
